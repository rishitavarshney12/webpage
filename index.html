            <h3>INDIA</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Less than thirty years before that enchanting Saturday night when Ravi Shastri’s voice rang through 
                television sets all over India, when even the spunky and exuberant Indian youth showed more interest
                 in an old-school CRT television at a local chai ki dukaan than the dance-floor at a pub, a pump-operator
                  in Ranchi awaited the birth of his third child. </p><br>

                        And it’s an Indian captain, who’s been absolutely magnificent,<br> in the night
                         of the final.’

                    Any cricket fan worth his salt just read this in Ravi Shastri's most dramatic voice
                    mahendra Singh Dhoni enchanted the Wankhede on the night of 2nd April 2011.

                    <h2>The Foundations</h2>
                    <div class="text">
                         <p>Hailing from Jharkhand, Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s rise through the ranks into international cricket is a tale of rebellion, extraordinary merit
                    , perseverance, and, most of all, belief. After being scouted on the whims of his school P.E. teacher as a wicketkeeper,
                     Dhoni created whispers in the cricketing circles of Ranchi - a teenaged boy with no measurable upper-body strength clearing boundaries
                      against some of the best fast bowlers of the district. However, the system failed him as he found it difficult to make the cut
                       against candidates of the more affluent A-tier states. Consequently, in a desperate move, he joined the Railways Ranji team and started to work
                        as a ticket collector at the Kharagpur railway station to make ends meet.

                    Nevertheless, in a few months, the stars started to align themselves for the
                     precocious wunderkind from Ranchi. Inspired by the KSCA, the BCCI started a country-wide
                      Training Research Development Wing to scout talent from the more financially backward states.
                       Dhoni immediately caught the eyes of the scouts and was sent on an A tour to Kenya, where his talent
                        burst forth for the world to see as he showcased his batting pyrotechnics against world-class bowlers in alien conditions.
                         He immediately shot to national reckoning and was selected for the tour of Bangladesh in November 2004. </p>
